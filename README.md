# Simulation of the Solar System

Developed simulation using the Euler method to model the dynamic behaviour of the solar system over 10 years with different initial conditions. Generated comprehensive data visualisations and analysis reports.

The laws of gravitational attraction are derived from Newtonian Mechanics and implemented by using a numerical method called the Euler method. General Relativity is not taken into account for the sake of simplicity
