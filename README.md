# Simulation of the Solar System\

Developed simulation using the Euler method to model the dynamic behavior of the solar system over a 10-year time span with different initial conditions. Generated comprehensive data visualisations and analysis reports.\

The laws of gravitational attraction are derived from Newtonian Mechanics and implemented ny using a numerical method called Euler method. General Relativity is not taken into account for the sake of simplicity
